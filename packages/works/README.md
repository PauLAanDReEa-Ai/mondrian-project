# packages/works

Measured neoplastic compositions and their schema (M2).

| Layer | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L0** | `schema/` | JSON Schema 2020-12 — Andrzejewski §3.2 primitives |
| **L1** | `works/<slug>/` | Measured works (`work.yml` + `MEASUREMENT.md`) |
| **Fixtures** | `fixtures/` | `valid.yml` + one-corruption broken cases |
| **Python** | `python/` | Pydantic mirror + derive / vary / catalog |

Reference work 1: `works/kunsthaus-1930-rbby/` (provisional measurement).

Do not invent proportions. Derived tracks never land in `work.yml`.
